# About
Hello ðŸ‘‹... I had been hearing about Flutter for a long time, but a little while ago I started writing lines of code with this technology thanks to the faculty under pressure of one of the course's chairs (Development of Mobile Applications), where my teacher used Flutter to teach the course, since then I've been enjoying the tool. Today I study it every day.

For the final exam, we were asked to develop an application of our choice. I'm passionate about personal organization and overall productivity, so I've developed an app that can help manage notes and tasks.

In a first version, the project is 100% offline, so I used the <strong>SQLite</strong> database to store the user information.

In it, the <strong>intl</strong> package was also used to make it possible for the user to select the date and time when that specific task has to be executed, in the near future, these same data will be used to issue an alert whenever a task has to be executed. be executed!
